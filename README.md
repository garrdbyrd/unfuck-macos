# Unfuck MacOS
## About
This is a set of script(s) and instructions that I am slowly contributing to as I learn how to bend the Apple ecosystem to my will. This should generally be thought of as a collection of "Windows-ification" instructions and scripts.

Despite being a mostly personal repo, please feel free to open issues, PRs, etc. I am always open to new ways of deconstructing Apple's anti-accessibility systems.

## Background
MacOS and the Apply ecosystem in general is so absurdly user hostile. Unfortunately, it is the best ecosystem for music production, so here I am. I've been spoiled by KDE Plasma, and now I'm locked in the shiny silver cage that is my refurbished Mac Mini. Hopefully this repository will help someone else traversing this wasteland of disgusting user interfaces and narrow-minded design (or at least my future self).
